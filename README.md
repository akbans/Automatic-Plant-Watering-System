# Automatic Plant Watering System üå±

This project is an **Automatic Plant Watering System** designed to monitor soil moisture levels and activate a water pump when the soil is too dry. The system uses an Arduino board, a soil moisture sensor, and a relay module to control the water pump. It ensures your plants stay hydrated even when you're away.

## üìù Project Description

The Automatic Plant Watering System helps maintain the health of your plants by:
- Monitoring the soil moisture level using a soil moisture sensor.
- Activating a water pump when the soil is dry.
- Deactivating the water pump once optimal moisture levels are reached.
- Providing real-time data through the Arduino serial monitor for diagnostics and status updates.
